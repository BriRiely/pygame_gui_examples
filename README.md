# Pygame GUI Examples
A few simple programs to demonstrate how to use features of the [pygame_gui](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui) module.

To run these programs you must first have installed the [pygame_gui](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui) project (which itself depends on pygame). 

It's also worth noting that [pygame_gui](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui) is designed to work best with pygame 2 which is not (currently) officially released, but is available on PyPi via pip. [pygame_gui](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui) and these examples are also only intended to work with python 3, if any of it does work with python 2 then that is purely by chance.
